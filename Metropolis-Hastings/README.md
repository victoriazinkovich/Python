### Modeling of the Ising lattice

1. The code works for a chain of spins in the two-dimensional case
2. The dependence of the average energy on temperature in the range from 0 to 4 $J/k$
is obtained, where $J$ is the interaction energy, $k$ is the Boltzmann constant
3. There is a phase transition in 2.27 $J/k$
4. The behavior of the system when an external magnetic field is added is considered. A graph of the dependence of the magnetic susceptibility above the Curie temperature proportional to $1/(T - T_C)$ is constructed
