Modeling of the Ising lattice

The code works for a chain of spins in the two-dimensional case
The dependence of the average energy on temperature in the range from 0 to 4 J/k is obtained, where J is the interaction energy, k is the Boltzmann constant
There is a phase transition in 2.27 J/k
The behavior of the system when an external magnetic field is added is considered. A graph of the dependence of the magnetic susceptibility above the Curie temperature proportional to 1/(T - T_C) is constructed
